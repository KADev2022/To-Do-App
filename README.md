# To-Do-App
To-Do App is a web application that manages your tasks to help you to stay organised and manage your daily activities. This is created in TypeScript.

## Setup
* Step 1 - Create a TypeScript configuration file using this command <code>tsc --init</code> and this will create the tsconfig.json file.<br>
* Step 2 - In the tsconfig.json file, set the <code>target</code> to <code>ES6</code>, the <code>outDir</code> folder to <code>./compile-js</code> for compiling TypeScript code and an <code>include</code> property to include the <code>app.ts</code> file.<br>
* Step 3 - Compile the TypeScript file using this command <code>tsc</code> and this will generate the <code>compile-js</code> folder that includes the JavaScript files that compiles the code that is written in the TypeScript file.<br>
